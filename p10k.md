# PowerLevek10k M1 Support

P10k is a fantastic OMZ theme.  Clearly my favorite when combined with Nerd Fonts. There are many articles on the details, here is one at random: https://medium.com/macoclock/how-to-make-your-terminal-pretty-using-ohmyzsh-and-powerlevel10k-19484f2a48b7

P10k and OMZ work great on M1 with the exception of git_statusd which will show as intel.

There are instructions on the [gitstatus dev site](https://github.com/romkatv/gitstatus)

Recompiling the git-statusd solves the issue.  I don't remember why I had 2 different installs. Based on that, I used 2 different approaches based on different configurations.  Both require `cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel10k` or where your p10k install is located.

## Option 1

If your folder has a `Makefile`, execute:
`make zwc`

## Option 2

Otherwise `./build -w -s` 

After recompile it is M1 optimized.  You will need to restart active terminals.
