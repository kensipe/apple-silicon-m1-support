# Network Ports  

This isn't really an M1 issue.  Closely tied to M1's release is the release of macOS Monterey Version 12.  Apple has decided to enable Macs to be an "AirPlay Receiver" in addition to being a "producer". The port used for years for AirPlay is port `5000` which is a common development port. 

You can move to another port.. or turn off the "AirPlay Reciever" in the "Sharing" tab of system properties.
